# Ensuring Effective Supervision of Taxpayers by Analyzing and Profiling Using External Sources
## Abstract
This research project addresses the significant challenges of tax avoidance and evasion in Indonesia, where an estimated $6.48 billion is lost annually due to these issues. With Indonesia ranking 11th out of 30 countries for tax avoidance, the importance of robust tax revenue is underscored, constituting around 82.98% of the state budget. The Directorate General Taxes of the Republic of Indonesia faces a daunting task of supervising a vast number of taxpayers, emphasizing the need for automated systems to streamline analysis and surveillance. The project proposes constructing a taxpayer profile using an API for data collection from financial news articles and employing Named Entity Recognition (NER) as a text analysis method. Using VF Corp. and Palo Alto Networks as examples, representing apparel and computer industries, respectively, the project aims to provide detailed insights into tax potential and identify growing industries for exploration. By combining News API and web scraping tools, the project seeks to create a model facilitating more effective tax analysis and exploration. Moreover, the developed model is not confined to the US context; it is adaptable and applicable to other countries, including Indonesia. The methodology of utilizing an API for data collection and employing NER as a text analysis method is transferable to diverse regulatory environments. By customizing the entities and industries of interest, tax authorities in other countries can leverage this model to enhance their tax exploration and revenue generation efforts. The automated system can be tailored to specific linguistic nuances and industry landscapes, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness in different cultural and economic contexts. Overall, this model provides a versatile framework that can be implemented globally to address the challenges of tax avoidance and evasion.
