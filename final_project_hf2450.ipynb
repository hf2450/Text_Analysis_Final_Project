The country is estimated to lose approximately $6.48 billion in unpaid taxes annually due to these problems. Moreover, Indonesia, a middle-income nation, is placed 11th out of 30 countries when it comes to the extent of tax avoidance. This ranking is based on data from the International Center for Policy and Research (ICPR) and the International Center for Taxation and Development (ICTD) ([Cobham, 2018](https://https://doi.org/10.1002/jid.3348)).\n","\n","Taxes are indeed crucial for Indonesia, and the issue of tax avoidance needs immediate attention. According to data, Indonesia's state revenue is planned to amount to `$`176.77 billion, consisting of tax revenue of `$`146.68 billion, non-tax state revenue of `$`30.62 billion, and grants of `$`25.42 million ([setkab.go.id, 2023](https://https://setkab.go.id/en/address-of-the-president-of-the-republic-of-indonesia-on-the-presentation-of-the-government-statement-on-the-bill-on-the-state-budget-for-the-2024-fiscal-year-and-its-financial-note-before-the-plena/)). This means that tax revenue accounts for around 82.98% of the Indonesian state budget's main source (`$`146.68 / `$`176.77) x 100%). Failure to achieve this revenue could potentially lead to a crisis fueled by increased debt.\n","\n","Intense supervision from revenue agents at the Directorate General Taxes of the Republic of Indonesia is needed to prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. However, this is more challenging than turning the palm of your hand because the proportion of revenue agents and taxpayers is quite different. One revenue agent must supervise around 422 taxpayers, whereas, in one year, there are only 365 days (Based on general knowledge, total taxpayers in Indonesia are around 19 million, and revenue agents are approximately 45,000. Thus, 422 = 19 million/45,000). Therefore, there must be several taxpayers who need to be better supervised. Automating the process of searching for taxpayers in cyberspace would be extremely helpful in streamlining the analysis and supervision of taxpayers. It can be quite a daunting task for revenue agents to sift through all the information available on cyberspace or financial news, one by one, to find what they need. An automated system would certainly make the process much more efficient and effective.\n","\n","This research project aims to construct a taxpayer profile utilizing an Application Programming Interface (API) to collect data from financial news articles and Named Entity Recognition (NER) as a text analysis method. The development of an NER is expected to efficiently parse out names of entities, which in this project are specific taxpayers, throughout financial news, along with various tax-related conditions that could be delved deeper. This project would take some taxpayers in the US as an example to build the model, such as VF Corp., an apparel industry, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc., a computer and other electronic products industry. Both companies represent micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME); in Indonesia, most MSMEs have low tax compliance. In addition, both industries are also industries that continue to develop and can be compared to each other.\n","\n","Confidently, the project might provide a rigorous response to these two questions. 1) Is it necessary to conduct a detailed analysis of the tax potential for VF Corp., and Palo Alto Networks, Inc., and 2) which industries are currently experiencing growth and are best suited for a tax potential exploration? The hypothesis posits that a thorough analysis of the tax potential of VF Corp., and Palo Alto Networks, Inc., would yield valuable insights into potential tax revenue. Additionally, it anticipates that specific industries currently experiencing growth will offer favorable opportunities for further tax exploration. Eventually, this project will enable the precise direction of tax potential exploration policies toward more advanced industry sectors, measured by the more tax-related conditions that appear along with taxpayers' names in the text analysis.\n","\n","## **Methods**\n","\n","### **Text Collection**\n","\n","The project employs a combination of News API and web scraping tools for data collection, with News API serving as the primary tool due to restrictions on web scraping for many online news articles. API, or Application Programming Interface, in this context, pertains to data APIs—interfaces crafted to facilitate data sharing and management, exemplified by the News API. These APIs function as software entities, varying in size from extensive systems to more streamlined structures. They act as intermediaries, connecting databases with users seeking access to the data ([Adam, 2019](https://medium.com/epfl-extension-school/an-illustrated-introduction-to-apis-10f8000313b9)). In contrast, web scraping involves directly extracting information from the internet. While manually copying and pasting data from a website represents a rudimentary form of web scraping, the term typically implies the use of automated tools and processes for data extraction ([Krisel, 2023](https://github.com/rskrisel/web_scraping_workshop)).\n","\n","When using News API, the initial step involves installing and importing the requests library from Python to facilitate data requests from URLs  ([Krisel, 2023](https://github.com/rskrisel/web_scraping_workshop)). Installing News API before initiating communication within the Python environment is crucial. To gain access to the News API library, individuals need to register on the News API website to obtain a token or key. Once acquired, this key allows the importation of several articles on the News API, and we can continue to import several important libraries. For instance, BeatifulSoup for the purpose of refining and interpreting HTML text data, utilizing Pandas for visualizing and manipulating tabular data, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for encoding data structures to ensure machine readability, Glob for establishing connections to directories in your operating system, Word Cloud for generating visual representations of word frequencies, and Matplotlib for visualizing the Word Clouds ([Krisel, 2023](https://github.com/rskrisel/web_scraping_workshop)). The last and also essential library that needs to be imported is pprint or Pretty Print, a utility module employed for displaying data structures in an organized and easily understandable manner ([Krisel, 2023](https://gist.github.com/rskrisel/4ff9629df9f9d6bf5a638b8ba6c13a68))."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9540,"status":"ok","timestamp":1700798802219,"user":{"displayName":"Hendyga Fuadillah","userId":"01568594263141597610"},"user_tz":300},"id":"aU-LXr_Et8Dp","outputId":"c63ae681-c765-4450-8859-21f29db395c4"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.31.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (3.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (2.0.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (2023.7.22)\n"]}],"source":["pip install requests"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"p8l4ocB8vZj-"},"outputs":[],"source":["import requests"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"OdOYlGuKv6rO"},"outputs":[],"source":["import json"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"n0Je8URc3XMC"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4397,"status":"ok","timestamp":1700798820031,"user":{"displayName":"Hendyga Fuadillah","userId":"01568594263141597610"},"user_tz":300},"id":"Z2FeFa2w4PqV","outputId":"cc16582d-d603-4aee-8ceb-d7da434b33a7"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting newsapi-python\n","  Downloading newsapi_python-0.2.7-py2.py3-none-any.whl (7.9 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests<3.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from newsapi-python) (2.31.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0.0->newsapi-python) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0.0->newsapi-python) (3.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0.0->newsapi-python) (2.0.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0.0->newsapi-python) (2023.7.22)\n","Installing collected packages: newsapi-python\n","Successfully installed newsapi-python-0.2.7\n"]}],"source":["!pip install newsapi-python"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Vn3MZaW-4XgE"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pprint"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0Ibr7v2r4fMQ"},"outputs":[],"source":["secret= 'a552a6f4f4b84a04a55eed90dd3f92f4'"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The data collection process can be initiated following the installation and importation of all essential libraries.

After configuring the parameters, the request is initiated, and the result is converted into JSON format, printed using the pretty print command. To gain a glimpse of the current condition of both entities, a strategic approach involves converting and printing the titles of the articles.

NLP, an interdisciplinary domain at the crossroads of linguistics, statistics, and computer science, navigates the intricacies of language understanding and manipulation. In the context of NER, the objective is to identify and categorize entities within a given text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, money, and more. This pivotal task in NLP plays a crucial role in various applications, contributing to advancements in information extraction, text analysis, and broader artificial intelligence endeavors. ([Krisel, 2023](https://github.com/rskrisel/NER_workshop/blob/main/NER_workshop.ipynb)). The first stage of applying NER involves installing and importing the spaCy library in Python, followed by loading the spaCy language
